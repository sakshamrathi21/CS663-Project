**Introduction:** 

In this project we have used a lossy compression method for cartoon-like images that exploits information at image edges. These edges are extracted using the Canny edge algorithm. Their locations are stored in a lossless way using JBIG. Moreover, we encode the grey or colour values at both sides of each edge by applying subsampling and PAQ coding. In the decoding step, information outside these encoded data is recovered by solving the Laplace equation, i.e. we in-paint with the steady state of a homogeneous diffusion process.![](./assets/Aspose.Words.f24ff4a6-bbc1-44ba-9262-89ed68c4f9b5.001.png)

Edge detection algorithms such as Marr Hildreth were used but results were poor, so canny edge algorithm is used.

**Encoding the contour location:** 

Edge Image (image which contains contours found by canny edge) is encoded and compressed using JBIG. It has been developed as a specialised routine for lossless as well as for lossy compression of bi-level images as mentioned in the paper.

**Encoding the contour pixel values:**  

Image is reduced by sampling colour values of pixels that are neighbour to edges, as edges contain most of the information, as proposed in the paper, other colour pixels are blacked out.

Subsampling along edge was experimented but it yielded poor recovery of the edges because of poor super-sampling (which could not be further explored due to time constraints).

**Storing the encoding data** 

Residual Image is encoded and compressed using PAQ compressor along-with the JBIG file to get one compressed version of the image file.

**Decoding the contour pixel values:**  

The Archive is decompressed using PAQ decompressor and then the edge image is restored using JBIG decoder.

**Reconstructing Missing Data:** 

The missing pixels are reconstructed (image in-painting) is performed using homogenous diffusion for interpolation. 

` `*tu* = *u*

The reconstructed data satisfies the Laplace equation  *u* = 0 .

Such a PDE can be discretised in a straightforward way by finite differences.

We tried anisotropic diffusion but could not make it work.

**Analysis: ![](./assets/Aspose.Words.f24ff4a6-bbc1-44ba-9262-89ed68c4f9b5.001.png)**

Huge shortcoming of this compression technique is that it works only for cartoon like images, because of the assumption that area inside a boundary has same colour, which is mostly observed in cartoon images. Also the difference in reconstructed and original image is visible (otherwise diffusion time has to be increased).

The compression ratios are high, note that the compression ratios reported are not on the primitive image, the images are saved in png format which implies image is compressed to 1.5-4 times on top of compression used by PNG.![](./assets/Aspose.Words.f24ff4a6-bbc1-44ba-9262-89ed68c4f9b5.001.png)

Steps

1. Run encoder.m with appropriate arguments imagePath, edgeImagePath, resImagePath and run compress.sh from the \*linux\* shell (you may have to install JBIG and PAC encoders).
1. Run decoder.sh from the \*linux\* shell and then decoder.m with appropriate arguments edgeImagePath, resImagePath, imagePath, savePath![](./assets/Aspose.Words.f24ff4a6-bbc1-44ba-9262-89ed68c4f9b5.001.png)
